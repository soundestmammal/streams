User Authentication will be done with OAuth 2.0

OAuth 2.0 for JS Application Running in the Browser

Results in a token that a browser app can use to make requests on behalf of the user.
Usually used when we have an app that only needs to access user data when they are logged in
Very Easy to set up because of JS library created by Google
